## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
![testResult.png](./examples/testResult.png)

**Overview**
---
In this project, I used a neural network with 4 convolutional layers to classify traffic signs. The training and validating details could be found in `writeup.md`.

**The Project**
---
The steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

Code details could be found in `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb`.
